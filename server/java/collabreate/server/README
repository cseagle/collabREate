Version 0.2.0 Initial release

Note:  This server component is also released as FC15 based virtual appliance.
       This Virtual Machine is largely a stock FC15 minimal install, with postgres/
       postgres-server, openjdk-java-1.6.0 packages, and 
       collabreate software already installed.
       See www.idabook.com/collabreate for more information.


QUICKSTART GUIDE

Of course you should read this entire file prior to using the collabreate server.
For the other 90% of users, here is a 6 step process that attempts to get you 
started.

1) install postgres (or mysql) and configure permissions (eg pg_hba.conf)
2) #./init_database.sh
3) #make
4) #make test     (to visually inspect)
5) #make install  (optional)

if you performed step 5 you can start the server by:
6) #/etc/init.d/collabreate start

if you chose not to install you can run from the build directory via scripts:
6) #./launch_server.sh server.conf

Add users using the manager interface.  Connect to the server via the plugin.

#./launch_manager.sh server.conf

EDITING THE CONFIGURATION

Several parameters are tunable, include database information, logging verbosity,
the TCP port number, etc.  These can be changed by editing server.conf

At the very least you should skim this file to verify default settings.  The 
default database type is PostgreSQL.


BUILDING THE SERVER 

Building the collabreate server requires the java SDK (tested with 1.6). For 
full functionality you also need a JDBC connector for your database (PostgreSQL
9.0 http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/postgresql-9.0-801.jdbc4.jar)

Due to the structure of some queries, PostgreSQL 8.2 or higher is required.

Unpack the archive:

#tar -zxf collabreate.tgz

The server subdirectory contains all the server components:

Compile the required classes:

#javac collabreate/server/*.java

At this point you can try out the server:

#java collabreate.server.CollabreateServer collabreate/server/server.conf


EXECUTABLE JAR FILES

Alternatively, cd into collabreate/server/ and use make:

#make all

At this point you can run the server via the launch_server.sh script

#./launch_server.sh server.conf

This launches the server in the background

#make install

This installs server files, control files, etc.  To visually inspect the 
install process prior to install, run "make test".  You can now start via
init.d

#/etc/init.d/collabreate start


CUSTOMIZING VIA YOUR ENVIRONMENT (optional)

While using the environmental variables is optional, specify JAVA_HOME is 
recommended.

Several build and management items can be configure by exporting environmental
variables.  If these variables are not set, either the script will attempt to
determine the correct setting or default values will be used.

JAVA_HOME   - home directory for java 
INSTALLDIR  - where to install the server, full path
MANDIR      - full path to the location of man files
INITDIR     - path to init.d
INITBIN     - name of file to place in init.d
COLLAB_USER - name of user account the server will run as
COLLAB_GROUP- group account

the provided management scripts also provide similar customization.  If you 
modified paths at build/install, you may need to make modifications here.

JAVA_HOME   - home directory for java 
COLLAB_SERVER_DIR - directory the server was installed into
COLLAB_LOG        - file that the scripts will log to
COLLAB_SCRIPT     - full path to collabctl
COLLAB_USER       - user account for collabreate server
COLLAB_GROUP      = group account

DATABASE SETUP

For database functionality there are a few more steps:

A database must be setup for use with collabreate.  
create a database user and a database (collabDB for example):
postgres:
   # createuser -U postgres collab 
   Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) y
   Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) y
   Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n
   CREATE ROLE
   # createdb -U collab collabDB
   CREATE DATABASE

   A sample .sql file is provided to install the schema:
   # psql -U collab -d collabDB -f dbschema.sql

mysql:
   The user account creation is part of the provided sql script
   # mysql < my_dbschema.sql

Finally you need to either install the JDBC jar file where java can find it, or 
provide the jar in the classpath on the command line:

(the following two lines should be executed as one line)
#java -cp "postgresql-9.0-801.jdbc4.jar:." 
collabreate/server/CollabreateServer server.conf

Alternatively, if you have built jars, you can use the launch_server.sh script.


USING THE SERVER

By default (via the example server.conf) the server logs to /var/log/collab.
You may specify an alternate log file location via the LogFile setting in the 
server configuration file.


INTERACTING WITH THE SERVER

A ServerManager application is included that allows you to create and list users
and projects from the local console.  The ServerManager may be launched using
the provided launch_manager.sh script:

#./launch_manager.sh

which uses the same server configuration file used for the server to determine
appropriate database parameters.

Once started, the manager provides a simple menu to the console.  The 
implemented functions are fairly easy to grasp, and perform actions such as 
adding users, listing users, listing projects, etc.  Listing and editing users
and projects have no effect in BASIC mode.


IMPORT/EXPORT

The ServerManager allows for importing and exporting projects.  Exported 
projects are stored in a binary file format, that contains all project
information including updates.  Currently, related projects (parent, child, 
snapshot, etc) and related users (owner, updaters, etc) are not imported. 
For this reason, when importing from a file a new owner must be selected from 
the current server.

PROJECT DELETION

Currently, project deletion does not 'cascade' in any way.  Deleting a
project simply deletes the project information and related updates - not
snapshots, child/parent projects, etc.


PERMISSIONS
Permissions can be assigned to users and to projects, furthermore both users
and projects each have a set of publish and subscribe permissions.

For a user to receive an update, that subscribe permission for that type of 
update must be granted for both the user and the project.

For a user that is connected to a project to make a particular update, the 
publish permission for that type of update must by granted for both the user 
and that project.

Permissions are granted by setting bits in the permissions bitfield (long)
here is a summary of that bitfeild (least significant is bit 0)
0      "Undefine"
1      "Make Code"
2      "Make Data"
3      "Segments"
4      "Renames"
5      "Functions"
6      "Byte Patch"
7      "Comments"
8      "Optypes"
9      "Enums"
10     "Structs"
11     "Flirt"
12     "Thunk"
13     "Xrefs"
14-63  "Reserved for future use"

If a user has only "Change comment" and "Name Change" publish permissions 
(0x48), those are the only to operations the user can perform, even if the 
project allows all changes (0x1FFF)

Similarly if a project only allows "Change comment", "Change Name", "Patch
Byte", and "Create/Delete/Change Struct" permissions (0x268) these are all 
that ANY user can perform even if the user is allows to make all changes i
(0x1FFF).

EXCEPTION: the project owner (which defaults to the creator), always has all 
permissions.

The default operation of the server is to allow all users and all projects 
to have full publish and subscribe permissions.

Note: these permissions are applied at the collabREate server and are 
independant of the publish and subscribe requests applied by the plugin.
This allows for creating complex publish and subscribe models to fit almost 
any scenario.
